# Tensor Visualization Toolkit
This Python toolkit provides functions to visualize 2D and 3D slices of multi-dimensional tensors using matplotlib. It is designed to help users explore and understand the structure of high-dimensional data by extracting and visualizing 2D and 3D slices.

Features
2D Slice Visualization: Extract and visualize a 2D slice from a 4D tensor along specified axes.

3D Slice Visualization: Extract and visualize a 3D slice from a 4D tensor along specified axes.

Customizable Axes: Choose which axes to visualize and which axes to fix.

Color Mapping: Use color maps to represent tensor values in the visualizations.
